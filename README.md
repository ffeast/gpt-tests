## What's this
This is just a bunch of toy GPT samples.
Each .html file is a standalone sample that doesn't require any 3rd party libraries and uses my DFP SB account with live serving ads.

## How to play with them
   ```
   npm i
   http-server -o
   ```
   And then just pick the sample you need in the opened browser window
